one = input()
two = input()
three = input()
four = input()
five = input()
six = input()
seven = input()
eight = input()
nine = input()
ten = input()

total = (one * 2) + (two * 3) + (three * 4) + (four * 5) + (five * 6) + (six * 7) + (eight * 9) + (nine * 10) + (ten * 11)

remainder = total % 11

answer = 11 - remainder

print answer

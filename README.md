checkdigit
==========

A python program which will find the check digit of a 10 digit number.

Simply add the numbers in the command line, and press enter until 10 figures are entered.
Once you press enter on the last number, you should see the check digit appear below your tenth number. 

Congratulations, you have successfully created a check digit! 

Things to be added: 

* Make an nice GUI interface.
* Make it an array, so that check digits for any number of numbers can be made. 
* Make the check digit appear in other forms with the numbers included, for instance a QR code.
